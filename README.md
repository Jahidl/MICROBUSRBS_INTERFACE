What has been done in this project:

Normalizes each listing into a flat shape (date, street, suburb, type, price, beds, baths, land, garage).

Provides simple filters: text search, property type, min bedrooms, and max price.

Computes KPIs (median/average price, median bedrooms) and a CSS-only “bar” view of average price by property type.
